Inheritance and Interfaces
This folder contains a Restaurant class, and Review class. The restaurant class contais methods and variables about a generic restaurant, and the review class contains methods and variables that hold information about restaurant reviews


Challenge
Create classes and interfaces to represent reviews of restaurants.

Approach & Efficiency
I took an Object Oriented approach. I encapsulated all my functionalities inside of seperate methods and put all my methods inside of a class
addReview -> 0(n) Where n represnets the size of the array list

API
void addReview(Review) : Adds a new review for thew restaurant
Srtring toString(): displayes a default statement for the restaurant based on the restaurants properties
