# java-fundamentals
This is the readme file for my java fundamentals repo.
It contains Lab 01 from code401
The basics directory has a Main.java file that contains three methods:
pluralize - which addes an 's' to the end of a word depending on what integer gets passed to it
flipNHeads - which generates a random number from 0 to 1 until n consecutive '1' or heads have been generated
clock - which keeps printing the current time after every second update
