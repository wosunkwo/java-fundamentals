Lab- 01
The Basics directory has a Main.java file that contains three methods:
pluralize - which addes an 's' to the end of a word depending on what integer gets passed to it
flipNHeads - which generates a random number from 0 to 1 until n consecutive '1' or heads have been generated
clock - which keeps printing the current time after every second update

Lab- 02
The Library basic directory contains an src folder which contains the code for "rolling dice", "contains duplicate", "calculate average", and "lowest average" functions as well as the unit test for all the functions.

Lab- 03
The Library basic directory contains an src folder which contains a Maps_TallyElection.java file which contains two functions: 
A weather function that keeps track of all the unique temperatures seen. Finally, iterates from the min temp to the max temp and creates a String containing any temperature not seen during the month and returns that String.
A tally function that accepts a List of Strings representing votes and returns one string to show what got the most votes.
The third part of the lab is a linter application that reads through a file and prints out an error message if any line in the file doesnt end with a semi colon.
