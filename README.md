# java-fundamentals
This is the readme file for my java fundamentals repo.
It contains Lab assignments from code401

## Week 1 | java- fundamentals
- [Day 1: Java primitives and control flow ](/basics/Main.java) 
- [Day 2: Arrays, for loops, imports, ArrayLists](/basiclibrary/src/)

Lab- 01
The Basics directory has a Main.java file that contains three methods:
pluralize - which addes an 's' to the end of a word depending on what integer gets passed to it
flipNHeads - which generates a random number from 0 to 1 until n consecutive '1' or heads have been generated
clock - which keeps printing the current time after every second update

Lab- 02
The Library basic directory contains an src folder which contains the code for "rolling dice", "contains duplicate", "calculate average", and "lowest average" functions as well as the unit test for all the functions.
